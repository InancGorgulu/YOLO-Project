### This folder provides the required weights for object detection in YOLO with Drone dataset. 

The results were achieved using a custom drone dataset, which is detailed in the dataset folder.

**best.pt:** Contains the weights of the YOLOv5 model that achieved the best performance during training. This file stores the weights from the point in training where the model performed best on the validation set, typically representing the highest accuracy and the lowest error rate in object detection tasks.

**last.pt:** Contains the weights of the model at the end of the training process. It represents the final state of the model after learning from all the training data. While it includes the most recent knowledge learned by the model, it may not always be the most accurate.
