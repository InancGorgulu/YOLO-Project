# C++ Programming

After we get the .onnx file related to our weight, we have to install the required OpenCV environment to infer the objects. Please make sure that you have the DNN module in your OpenCV environment. I downloaded OpenCV from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/).

_Note: If you want to do inference on your GPU, you have to install the CUDA library as well, but this guide doesn't include the required steps to use the project on the GPU._
