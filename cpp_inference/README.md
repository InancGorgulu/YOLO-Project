# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: 'cpp_programming' and 'export_to_onnx', each focusing on different stages of model preparation and deployment for object detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm.

## cpp_programming
The cpp_programming section outlines the steps required to set up a C++ environment to perform object detection using a YOLOv5 model in ONNX format. It emphasizes the need to have the OpenCV environment installed with the DNN module enabled for inference. The main logic of the inference process is described in the main.cpp file, complete with detailed comments.

## export_to_onnx
The export_to_onnx section provides a step-by-step guide on how to export the YOLOv5 model to ONNX format. It includes instructions on cloning the YOLOv5 repository, installing dependencies, and executing the export command.
