# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: `cpp_programming` and `export_to_onnx`, each focusing on different stages of model preparation and deployment for object detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm.

## cpp_programming
This section outlines the steps required for making inference in a C++ environment to perform object detection using a YOLOv5 model in ONNX format. The main logic of the inference process is described in the _main.cpp_ file, complete with detailed comments.

## export_to_onnx
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to export the YOLOv5 model to ONNX format. It includes instructions on cloning the YOLOv5 repository, installing dependencies, and executing the export command.
